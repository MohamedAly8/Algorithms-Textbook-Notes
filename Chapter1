Algorithms : Describe a finite, deterministc, and effective problem solving method that can be a computer program
- Can describe procedure in natural language
- Suitable for any programming language
- Involve data structure (A way of organizing data)


## 1.1
  8 bit Max Integers:
    111 1111(in binary) = 127(in decimal) ; for a signed integer
    1111 1111(in binary) = 255(in decimal) ; for an unsigned integer
    
   i++ vs ++i
   
   i++ - i assigned first then incremented
   ++i - i incremented then assigned
